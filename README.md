![Users_retiring](https://github.com/CaptCarmine/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Misc/Deliverable_retiring%20titles.png?raw=true)

1. As seen in the image of the retiring users, as Pewlett-Hackard. There is a large number of employees retiring, with just the Senior Engineer title, showing around 30,000 people leaving.
2. The retirement total of employees looking to leave is around 133,00
3. The mentorship eligibility program is once step into resolving that wave, but in our search we only found 1,500 users eligible.
4. That means that the mentorship program will only cover about 1% of the jobs leaving in the silver Tsunami.

## Summary
<!-- Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami.
-->
"How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

We will need to be able to cover, at least an additional 130,000 jobs to cover gap, not accounting for growth. That means we will need to widely expand the mentorship program, as well as look for other ways to hire new employees.

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

As we search there currently is not enough, employees able to teach the next generation of pewlett-hackard workers.
